### What is the Multi-cloud?

* * *

> The future of business services relies on cloud computing, storage & micro-services. 
The mass transition has already begun. Organizations across all industries, 
regardless of size, have concluded that many of their fundamental challenges can 
be handled much better by cloud platforms. Many of them are gradually outsourcing 
their workloads from corporate data centers to the cloud, especially cloud 
platforms such as Azure, AWS and Google. However, new tools, 
apps and functions are added to them every day, so the architecture and operation of 
cloud platforms has become even more complex than it first was. This complexity has 
led to platforms that use a single heterogeneous architecture to contain multiple 
cloud services to be referred to as the “Multi-cloud”.
 
> These platforms distribute various assets, applications, software and other features 
among several public & private cloud environments. These multi-cloud environments are 
meant to prevent dependence on any single platform, such as Microsoft Azure, so companies 
can minimize risk from either lagtime or data loss. Switching to a multi-cloud service also 
increases the storage space and computing power available compared to normal cloud services. 
This added flexibility also leads to that complexity, between trying to handle multiple providers, 
keep up with various regulations, maximize benefit, and negate loss. Instead of managing everything on 
their own, companies are now turning to new providers of managed cloud services & modern cloud operations, such as CLOUDETEER.

### Our OPS.Stack

In regards to several mid-/large-sized cloud projects, we have seen the most challenging requirements for agile cloud operations and therefore have developed our own multi cloud operational-stack.
Based on well-known Open Source components used by cloud-native companies.
